        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Life shapes and molds us. Micah Clay hopes that his songs may bring some sort of encouragement to you along your sojourn.
        Youâ€™re not alone, you are loved and you are worthy of love.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Okey, Alright, Fine.   </p>
